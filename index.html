Given that motivation is the root of all other abilities, qualities and tasks you possess and carry out, it is probably the most crucial component that one should build up.

                    In addition to Motivational speech  we are also collecting the E-waste(charger, earphones, Hard disk,wires & cables,.etc) from the students and faculties in collaboration with ERODE CAUVERY LIONS CLUB. This is the opportunity for us to dispose of our electronic waste showing our responsibility towards the environment. As Technology advances, we tend to accumulate a large number of outdated or broken electronic devices.
                    
                    The upcoming E-waste collection event is a convenient and responsible way to dispose of these items. The E-waste will be collected from Faculty’s in Faculty Quarters and also in the Chemistry lab. Those who are willing can give their E-waste in the respective venue or contact student coordinators for help.
